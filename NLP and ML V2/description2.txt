1. TF-IDF Text Vectorization
What it is:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
How it works:
Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a term occurs in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Reduces the weight of terms that appear frequently in many documents (common words).
The product of TF and IDF assigns more weight to important, distinguishing words in a document.
Benefit:
Helps convert textual data into a numerical format, making it possible for machine learning algorithms to work with the data.
2. Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression
What it is:
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm often used when the target variable is binary (like positive vs negative sentiment).
How it works:
Logistic Regression applies a weighted sum of input features (in this case, TF-IDF vectors) to classify the input text as belonging to one of two classes.
It outputs probabilities that a given input belongs to a particular class.
Benefit:
Compared to simpler models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression allows for more refined decision boundaries, potentially improving classification performance.
3. Comparison with Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes:
A probabilistic classifier that makes strong independence assumptions between features.
Good for quick and simple models, but it can be less accurate because it assumes that all features (words) are independent of each other.
Logistic Regression:
More flexible than Naive Bayes, as it doesnâ€™t rely on independence assumptions.
This often leads to better performance in more complex datasets.
