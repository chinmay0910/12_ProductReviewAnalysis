This version introduces a more advanced approach to sentiment analysis by leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a deep learning model specifically designed for sequence data such as text. Unlike previous versions, where simpler machine learning models were used, this version adopts a word embedding technique to better capture the context of words in reviews. The sequential model allows for improved handling of long-term dependencies in the text, leading to more accurate sentiment predictions. This deeper learning approach significantly enhances the overall performance and precision of the sentiment analysis process.
