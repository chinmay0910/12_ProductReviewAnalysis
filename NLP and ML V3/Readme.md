## Version 3: Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

### Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis using LSTM**:
  - In this version, we transition from simpler models to a **deep learning** approach using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**. LSTMs are designed to process sequential data, making them well-suited for handling textual data like product reviews.
  
- **Word Embedding and Sequential Model**:
  - **Word embeddings** are employed to convert the text into numerical vectors, allowing the model to better understand the relationships and context of words in a sentence. This version utilizes a **sequential neural network** with LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in the text data, which improves the sentiment prediction accuracy.

- **Deeper Learning Approach**:
  - By leveraging **LSTM**, this version of the project dives deeper into the text data, improving the quality of sentiment analysis. As a result, the accuracy of predictions has significantly improved compared to previous versions, making the analysis more reliable and insightful.
