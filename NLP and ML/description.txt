Naive Bayes Algorithm:

A simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with the assumption that the features (words in this case) are independent.
Suitable for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, where it calculates the likelihood of a text belonging to a certain class (e.g., positive or negative sentiment).

Bag-of-Words Model:

A common technique for text vectorization in NLP, where text is represented as an unordered collection of words (without considering grammar or word order).
Each unique word in the corpus becomes a feature, and its frequency (or presence) is used as the value for that feature, creating a fixed-length vector.

Mock Labels for Sentiment:

Since real data may not always be available, mock labels (e.g., predefined positive or negative tags) can be used for testing and training the model.
Later, these can be replaced with actual sentiment labels (e.g., extracted from a labeled dataset) for a more realistic evaluation of model performance.
